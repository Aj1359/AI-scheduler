### **Example 1: Morning Schedule Generation**
```
User: "Create my schedule for today"
AI: "I've generated 3 optimized schedules based on your course timetable, priority tasks, and incomplete items from yesterday. 

Schedule A (Recommended - 92% efficiency):
‚Ä¢ 09:00-10:30: Advanced Algorithms (Fixed)
‚Ä¢ 11:00-12:00: Gym Session (Target: Fitness)
‚Ä¢ 13:00-15:00: Complete ML Assignment (Incomplete from yesterday)
‚Ä¢ 15:30-16:30: Study Neural Networks (Priority: High)
‚Ä¢ 17:00-18:00: Family Call (Target: Social)

This schedule prioritizes your incomplete ML assignment while maintaining your fitness goals and fixed commitments. Would you like to apply this schedule?"
```

### **Example 2: Live Modification**
```
User: "I need to add a doctor appointment at 2pm"
AI: "I see this conflicts with your ML Assignment (13:00-15:00). Here are your options:

Option A: Split ML Assignment into 1-hour sessions at 13:00 and 16:00
Option B: Move entire ML Assignment to tomorrow and extend today's Neural Networks study
Option C: Reschedule doctor appointment to 15:30 (if flexible)

Which would you prefer?"
User: "Option A"
AI: "Perfect! I've updated your schedule. The ML Assignment is now split into two focused 1-hour sessions with your doctor appointment at 14:00. All notifications have been updated."
